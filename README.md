# Probabilistic Information Extraction from Radar, CMOS, and Electro-optical Data (PIERCED)
----------------------------------------

Applications of RFS-based algorithms for tracking aerial vehicles. 

MATLAB simulations utilize the [BREW](https://github.com/Dawson-Pierce/brew) package that performs advanced target tracking for various distributions. Everything will be moved to C++ for hardware implementations. 

NOTE: This code is still in development and is in no way promised to perform to any specific standard.
